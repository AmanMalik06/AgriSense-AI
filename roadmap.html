  <h2>🛣️ Project Roadmap</h2>

  <p>
    The development of AgriSense AI is planned in structured phases,
    ensuring steady progress from research to deployment while allowing
    continuous improvement and scalability.
  </p>

  <h3>📍 Phase 1: Problem Research & Data Collection</h3>
  <p>
    Identify key agricultural challenges faced by farmers through research.
    Collect relevant datasets related to crop yield, soil conditions,
    weather patterns, and seasonal trends from reliable sources.
  </p>

  <h3>📍 Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Exploration</h3>
  <p>
    Clean, normalize, and analyze the collected data using Python
    and Jupyter Notebooks. Perform exploratory data analysis to
    identify meaningful patterns and correlations.
  </p>

  <h3>📍 Phase 3: Machine Learning Model Development</h3>
  <p>
    Develop and evaluate machine learning models for crop yield prediction
    and risk assessment. Optimize model performance using suitable
    algorithms and validation techniques.
  </p>

  <h3>📍 Phase 4: Prediction Pipeline Creation</h3>
  <p>
    Integrate trained models into a prediction pipeline that converts
    raw inputs into structured outputs, making results ready for analytics
    and visualization.
  </p>

  <h3>📍 Phase 5: Analytics & Dashboard Development</h3>
  <p>
    Design interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize predictions,
    trends, and insights. Enable filtering by region, crop type,
    and season for effective decision-making.
  </p>

  <h3>📍 Phase 6: Cloud Integration & Future Expansion</h3>
  <p>
    Plan cloud-based deployment for scalable data storage and processing.
    Future enhancements include real-time data integration, mobile access,
    and collaboration with agricultural institutions.

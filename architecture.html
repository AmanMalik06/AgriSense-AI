  <h2>🏗️ System Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    AgriSense AI follows a modular, scalable architecture that separates
    data ingestion, machine learning, analytics, and visualization layers.
    This design allows easy experimentation, deployment, and future expansion.
  </p>

  <h3>📥 Data Sources</h3>
  <p>
    The system ingests agricultural datasets including crop yield records,
    soil parameters, weather data, and seasonal information.
    These datasets may originate from government portals, research datasets,
    or manually collected farm data.
  </p>

  <h3>🧠 Machine Learning Layer</h3>
  <p>
    Data preprocessing and model development are carried out using
    Jupyter Notebooks. Machine learning algorithms analyze historical
    patterns to generate predictions related to crop yield and risk factors.
    Model outputs are stored as structured datasets for further analysis.
  </p>

  <h3>⚙️ Data Processing & Storage</h3>
  <p>
    Cleaned data and prediction outputs are organized into tabular formats
    suitable for analytics. This layer ensures consistency between raw inputs
    and visualization-ready data.
  </p>

  <h3>📊 Analytics & Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    Power BI dashboards consume the processed datasets to present insights
    through interactive charts, maps, and filters.
    Users can explore regional trends, compare crop performance,
    and identify patterns easily.
  </p>

  <h3>🌐 Presentation Layer</h3>
  <p>
    This website acts as the presentation and documentation layer,
    describing the problem, solution, architecture, and roadmap
    for stakeholders, evaluators, and future collaborators.
  </p>

  <h3>🔁 End-to-End Flow</h3>
  <p>
    Data → Preprocessing → Machine Learning Models → Predictions →
    Power BI Dashboards → Decision Support
